## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added RSC + DAL hybrid read pattern with `initialData` + `initialDataUpdatedAt: 0` to `data-ownership-cache-tanstack.md`.
- Added input parsing/length caps and defense-in-depth ownership filter sections to `security-dal-and-auth.md`.
- Added bulk-write RPC (`jsonb_to_recordset`), Postgres error → typed `ApiError` mapping, and explicit-column selection sections to `supabase-persistence-boundaries.md`.
- Added new reference `observability-and-sentry.md` (lazy SDK loader, PII redaction, user context without email, route handler capture).
- Added compound-provider split pattern to `component-structure-composehooks.md`.
- Added explicit variants vs mode-discriminator pattern to `state-placement.md`.
- Added localized Standard Schema → Mantine validator bridge section to `forms-and-actions.md`.
- Added new reference `notifications-and-feedback.md` (semantic `notify*` helpers, global mutation error notifier, unified `useConfirm` hook).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Added architecture-first consolidated references: glossary, Clean Architecture boundaries, runtime/compile-time boundaries, security/DAL/auth, data ownership, backend service boundaries, Supabase persistence boundaries, and testing by layer.
- Added UI convention references for Server/Client boundary, component structure with `composeHooks`, forms/actions, state placement, and styling/i18n.

### Changed

- Reduced the reference corpus from 51 files to 14 focused decision files.
- Reframed both skills as architecture/convention contracts instead of Next.js, React, Supabase, Mantine, or TanStack documentation snapshots.
- Updated `nextjs-architecture/SKILL.md` to route by layer, boundary, data owner, service API, persistence, and test strategy.
- Updated `react-component-creator/SKILL.md` to route by UI boundary, file structure, forms/actions, state placement, styling, and i18n conventions.

### Removed

- Removed granular API-doc rules for Cache Components, parallel/intercepting routes, exact action APIs, webhook/idempotency details, Mantine styling, i18n APIs, and React hook basics. Consumers should fetch current official docs for syntax.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- Added explicit minimum package versions to the compatibility matrix.
- Expanded the Mantine + Standard Schema validator rule with a complete synchronous field-error adapter.
